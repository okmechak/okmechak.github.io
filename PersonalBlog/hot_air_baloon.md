# Hot-Air-Balloon

Hot Air Balloon - lighter than air aircraft that gains its lift through the use of buoyant gas. In this case - hot gas. 
Average density of aircraft is lower than the density of atmosphere air.

__Yeap, at beginning I thought to name balloon as EUROPA. But Last version should be - Sunday.__

Repository contains code which helps to project hot air balloon.

Program consist of three main files:
- balloon.pas - helps to project geometry of your own balloon.
- pascal.pas - evaluates phisical forces and parameters of balloon.
- 3D-model.pas - used for 3D visualization of balloon.

## Sunday

Also repository contains my own project for one person Hot Air Ballon(see folder Tup "A14" Sunday).
Why Sunday? Becouse Ballon demmands good weather conditions for flight, temperature, wind, hummidity etc.. 
in same way as we demand a good weather to sunday walk ;)

Some main model parameters are contained in:
- info.txt
- main-parameters.txt
- Money-And-Tools.txt

But let write down two most imporatnt of them:
- __Lift mass - 180 kg__ 
- __Volume - 650 m^3__

As you can see it is pretty big balloon!

## History

### First Part

My stepfather gave me love to sky when I was child. He described principle of wing, how it works, 
also we have done several paper planes. I loved them! As time was passing.. I went to local 
library where was internet. Where for the first time I discovered Google and Wikipedia, where was a lot information
about deltaplanes, wings, aero- hydrodynamics etc. Structure sheets of deltaplanes its sizes and components.
And I started gathering information about how to do one for myself. It took me a lot of time, till moment when
I realized that it is quite difficult to make deltaplane.

Some time later, I was watching National Geographic channel about some small community of people in middle 
of Pacific Ocean, which had tradiotion to make floating on water hot air balloons. At this was that moment, which I was waiting for.
I realized that this is most easy and chip aircraft to do. At first I was doing small balloons from trash bags, but with
time things was getting bigger and more complicated...

### Second Part
TODO: actual developmen and fall of process..
